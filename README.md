# Go-Back-N Protocol Simulator

This is a Python-based simulator for the **Go-Back-N (GBN)** protocol, featuring both a command-line and a PyQt5 graphical user interface (GUI). It was developed as a course project for **EEL 4781: Computer Communication Networks**, by Professor 
Saleem Sahawneh at the University of Central Florida.

## Features

- Simulates sender, receiver, and channel behaviors for the GBN protocol
- PyQt5 GUI for interactive parameter tuning and visualization
- CLI mode for quick simulations

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- PyQt5

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
````

## Usage

Run the simulator from the command line:

```bash
# CLI Mode (default):
python simulator.py

# GUI Mode:
python simulator.py --gui
```

Use the `--gui` flag to launch the interactive PyQt5-based GUI for configuring and visualizing the protocol behavior.
